#Interview prep

- The people that interview you aren't always technical 
- Use buzz words and keywords that can be understood by the interviewee 
- the person that is asking needs to talk less
    - you have to lead the interview 
  

  
###How to lead the interview 

- Have a good elevator speech 
- They want to get to know you personally not technically/skill mindset
- USP (Unique selling price/point) what makes you stand out
